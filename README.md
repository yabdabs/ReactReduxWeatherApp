# Weather-React

### This is a Code-Along To Stephen Grider's [Modern React With Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview). This is the second major project code along.

#### A user can search for a city to display the 5 day weather forecast. Information on Temperature, Pressure and Humidity become available on charts. The searched cities location on google maps will also appear in the 'City' section. 

### Changes I made:
* None. Purpose was to get experience using redux, understanding actions, action creators, and reducers in a react application

Homepage
